# Speech-Assistant
This program was heavily inspired by NeuralNine, 
The machine learning models were not designed by me. 

Speech assistant in python that can do a variety of tasks. </br>
Download the necessary libraries: neuralintents, speech_recognition, pyttsx3, webbrowser. </br>
After running the program wait for the model to finish training. </br>
Say something related to one of the following topics (functionality as of now): </br>
-search the internet for something </br>
-create a note </br> 
-add something to a to do list </br>
-look something up on a map </br>
-search something on the dictionary </br> </br>

When trying to search something state the nature of what you'd like to search first (E.g. I'd like you to search this location). </br>
Then the assistant will respond by asking you what to search and then you state it. </br>
Say Exit, Bye or something of the like to close the program.  </br>
