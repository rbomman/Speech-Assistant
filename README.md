# Speech-Assistant
This program was heavily inspired by NeuralNine

Speech assistant in python that can do a variety of tasks.
Download the necessary libraries: neuralintents, speech_recognition, pyttsx3, webbrowser.
After running the program wait for the model to finish training.
Say something related to one of the following topics (functionality as of now):
-search the internet for something
-create a note
-add something to a to do list
-look something up on a map
-search something on the dictionary

When trying to search something state the nature of what you'd like to search first.
Then the assistant will respond by asking you what to search and then you state it.
Says Exit, Bye or something of the like to close the program.
